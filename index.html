      <h1>Welcome to the iOS Hacker Wiki</h1>
      <p>If you have anything you want added to this wiki, feel free to open a <a href="https://github.com/iOS-10-Stuffs/iOS-10-stuffs.github.io/pulls">Pull Request</a> or Tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/ClevrPwn">@ClevrPwn</a>.</p>
      <h2><a href="https://bitbucket.org/clevrpwn/ios-10-stuffs/wiki/Kexts%20list">Kext list</a></h2>
      <p>List of all the kexts included... pretty self explanatory.</p>
      <h2><a href="https://bitbucket.org/clevrpwn/ios-10-stuffs/wiki/Mach%20Traps%20and%20MIG%20tables">Mach Traps and MIG tables</a></h2>
      <p>Mach system calls are commonly known as "traps".</p>
      <p>At the trap level, the interface to most Mach abstractions consists of messages sent to and from kernel ports representing those objects. The trap-level interfaces (such as <code>mach_msg_overwrite_trap</code>) and message formats are themselves abstracted in normal usage by the Mach Interface Generator (MIG). MIG is used to compile procedural interfaces to the message-based APIs, based on descriptions of those APIs.</p>
      <h2><a href="https://bitbucket.org/clevrpwn/ios-10-stuffs/wiki/Sysctls">sysctls</a></h2>
      <p><code>sysctl</code> is an interface for examining and dynamically changing parameters in UNIX-like operating systems.</p>
      <h2><a href="https://bitbucket.org/clevrpwn/ios-10-stuffs/wiki/UNIX%20syscalls">UNIX Syscalls</a></h2>
      <p>A system call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a hard disk drive), creation and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling.</p>
